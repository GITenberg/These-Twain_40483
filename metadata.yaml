description: These twain (1916) is the third novel in the Clayhanger series. Edwin
  Clayhanger, having saved Hilda from destitution by marrying her, must now not only
  accept her son by a former lover, but also her outspokenness. Bennett's title for
  this novel suggests the complexity of how Hilda and Edwin attempt to compromise
  their divergent attitudes for the sake of their marriage.
